General ideas.
Create a new thread within this thread a looped function will routinely call (post to event bus) a custom subscribed method.
The regularity of this subscribed event will allow for a time frame granularity more precise than the actual render time of the game itself.
Because of this, we can then use plugins that LISTEN for this event and perform bot logic.
This bot logic will likely listen to tiles, monsters, etc. It will then send out custom Mouse Events on the stack (gotta figure that out).
